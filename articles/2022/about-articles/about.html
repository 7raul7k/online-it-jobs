            <h3>Type of Web Development Services</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../../images/web-service.jpg" >
        <p>Websites come in many forms, and each is built purposely for the business. To know which site suits your business, here are the most popular website types to choose from:</p>

        <h4>Corporate</h4>

        <p>A corporate website is what any startup business needs. Remember how everyone relies on the internet? If one hears about your business, the first thing they will do is try to search for information online. Without a corporate website, how can they verify that you are legit and credible?</p>
        
        <p>Corporate websites may not directly sell products or services. The purpose of corporate websites is to provide information about your business. In this way, potential clients will know how to get in touch with you.</p>
    
        <h4>Ecommerce</h4>

        <p>Ecommerce websites are most commonly known as online stores. One perfect example of this is Amazon, the most successful eCommerce retailer. This type of site allows you to take online payments for products and services.</p>

        <p>Through an eCommerce website, the business can display its products and services, accompanied by their corresponding prices. The customers choose from the offers and pay through the website’s payment portal.</p>

            <h3>BlockChain Services</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../../images/blockchain-service.jpg">
        <h4>How it works? </h4>
        <p>A public blockchain is the first type of blockchain technology. The public blockchain is a permissionless distributed ledger technology that allows anyone to join and conduct transactions. It is an open variant in which each user keeps a copy of the ledger. It implies that anyone with access to the internet can explore the public blockchain. </p>

        <p>The bitcoin public blockchain was among the first public blockchains to be made available to the general public. It made it possible for anyone with an internet connection to conduct decentralized transactions. </p>

        <h4>Advantages  </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The public blockchain is open to everyone. </li>
            <li>It fosters trust throughout the entire user community</li>
            <li>Everyone is motivated to work toward enhancing the public network. </li>
            <li>No middlemen are needed for the public blockchain to function. </li>
            <li>Depending on how many nodes are involved, public blockchains are mostly safe. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Disadvantages </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> The network may be slow, and businesses cannot impose access or use restrictions. According to Godefroy, attackers can unilaterally change a public blockchain network if they control 51% or more of its computing power</li>
            <li>Public blockchains also struggle with scalability. As more nodes connect to the network, it becomes slower. </li>
        </ul>
