            <h3>What does a web developer do?</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="/images/web-developer-module.jpg">
        <p>A web developer makes and maintains websites. They are in charge of a site’s overall look and feel. Web developers also handle the technical aspects of a website, including its performance (website speed) and capacity (the maximum amount of traffic the site could handle at a given time). A web developer is usually knowledgeable in both graphic design and programming.</p>
        <p>Web developers deal with different kinds of websites, including e-commerce, gaming, and news sites. These different website types have certain requirements. For instance, a gaming website must deftly handle advanced graphics. Ecommerce sites, on the other hand, would require the integration of a payment-processing feature and the capacity to deal with stock coming in and out. A web developer decides a site’s applications and designs accordingly.</p>

         <h3>What's the difference between a web developer and a web designer?</h3>
    </header>

        <p>A web developer is primarily concerned with a website’s features and functionality. A web designer is more focused on the art direction and aesthetics of a site. They create the graphics, logo, and layout that convey a website’s look and feel. Web developers usually dabble with computer languages, such as HTML, JavaScript, Python, and PHP. Web designers typically employ software tools, such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, for their work. Though a web developer could design a site too, a web designer is a specialist.</p>

            <h3>Why are web developers continually learning?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>A website is never finished or complete. Though a website creation project has a definite start and end date, a website needs constant nurturing. Just when a site looks perfect, a glitch shows up from nowhere. Many times website owners want fresh elements to be added to their sites. To serve their clients better over a period, web developers have to constantly learn and evolve.</p>
