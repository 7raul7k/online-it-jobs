        <h3>What is Cyber Security?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Cybersecurity is a process that enables organizations to protect their applications, data, programs, networks, and systems from cyberattacks and unauthorized access. Cybersecurity threats are rapidly increasing in sophistication as attackers use new techniques and social engineering to extort money from organizations and users, disrupt business processes, and steal or destroy sensitive information. 

        To protect against these activities, organizations require technology cybersecurity solutions and a robust process to detect and prevent threats and remediate a cybersecurity breach. </p>

        <h3>How Does Cybersecurity Work?</h3>
    </header>
    <img src="/images/1638977146054.jpg">
   <p>Technology is crucial to protecting organizations' devices, networks, and systems. Critical cybersecurity technologies include antivirus software, email security solutions, and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs). It’s important to keep in mind that your technology portfolio is only as good as the frequency and quality of its updates. Frequent updates from reputable manufacturers and developers provide you with the most recent patches, which can mitigate newer attack methods.</p>

        <h3>1.People</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Employees need to understand data security and the risks they face, as well as how to report cyber incidents for critical infrastructure. This includes the importance of using secure passwords, avoiding clicking links or opening unusual attachments in emails, and backing up their data. In addition, employees should know exactly what to do when faced with a ransomware attack or if their computer detects ransomware malware. In this way, each employee can help stop attacks before they impact critical systems.</p>

        <h3>2.Infrastructure</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Organizations need a solid framework that helps them define their cybersecurity approach and mitigate a potential attack. It needs to focus on how the organization protects critical systems, detects and responds to a threat, and recovers from an attack. As part of cybersecurity awareness, your infrastructure should also include concrete steps each employee needs to take in the event of an attack. By having this kind of emergency response manual, you can limit the degree to which attacks impact your business.</p>

        <h3>3.Vulnerabilities</h3>
    </header>
    <p>A cybersecurity solution needs to prevent the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited. This includes protecting all devices, cloud systems, and corporate networks. When thinking about vulnerabilities, it’s also important to include those introduced by remote and hybrid employees. Consider vulnerabilities in the devices they use to work, as well as the networks they may connect to as they log into your system.</p>

        <h3>Why Is Cybersecurity Important For Enterprises?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Cybersecurity is crucial for enterprises because, according to a recent IBM report, the average cost of a data breach in the United States is $9.44 million. Worldwide, the price tag of an enterprise breach is $4.35 million. Enterprises need cybersecurity to protect themselves from the hordes of opportunistic hackers and thieves looking to steal data, sabotage systems, and extort funds. If they successfully penetrate an enterprise system, the payout can be significant. For example, attackers can earn, on average, $9,640 from selling access to a hacked network.</p>
    
    <p>In the event of an attack, the damage can expand to include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Monetary losses</li>
        <li>Sullied business relationships</li>
        <li>A poor reputation among customers and across your industry</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>What Are the Different Categories of Cybersecurity?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Various types of cybersecurity enable organizations to defend their various systems. Tools for cybersecurity include:</p>
</section>

<section>
    <header>
        <h3>1. Network Security</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Network security is the use of devices, processes, and technologies to secure corporate networks. Organizations’ increasingly complex networks introduce new vulnerabilities across various areas, including applications, data, devices, locations, and users. Network security tools can prevent threats, close potential vulnerabilities, prevent downtime, and avoid regulatory noncompliance.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <header>
        <h3>2. Application Security</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Application security is the process of enhancing the security of mobile and web applications. This typically occurs during development to ensure apps are safe and protected when deployed, which is crucial as attackers increasingly target attacks against apps. Application security tools enable organizations to test apps, detect threats, and cover them with encryption.</p>

    <header>
        <h3>3. Information Security</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Information security, also known as InfoSec, secures data from unauthorized access, deletion, destruction, modification, or misuse. It involves using practices and processes to protect data when stored on devices and in transit.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <header>
        <h3>4. Operational Security</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Operational security (OPSEC) is a process that protects sensitive information and prevents unauthorized access. OPSEC encourages organizations to look at their infrastructure and operations from the perspective of an attacker. It allows them to detect unusual actions or behavior, as well as discover potential vulnerabilities and poor operation processes. </p>
    
    <p>Addressing these threats and weaknesses enables companies to implement security best practices and monitor communication channels for suspicious behavior.</p>
