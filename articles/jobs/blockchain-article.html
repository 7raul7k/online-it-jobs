            <h3>What Is Blockchain?</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../images/bitcoin-cryptocurrency.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Blockchain is a continuously growing list or public ledger, called blocks, that are linked and secured using cryptography. While it can be used in a variety of ways, blockchains have most traditionally been used for financial transactions.</p>
        <p>You can think of a blockchain like a spreadsheet that has been duplicated hundreds or thousands of times across a network of computers. The network has been programmed to update this spreadsheet, across the entire network, regularly. If you can picture this, then you are on your way to understanding blockchains.</p>

            <h3>What Are The Benefits of Blockchain?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Blockchain has a number of benefits. It keeps information secure but readily accessible, and the information it handles can be accessed by multiple people at once.</p>
        <p>Because the information contained on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database, there are a few key advantages. By decentralizing the database, it is incredibly difficult for a hacker to break into and corrupt. Real talk: when dealing with financial transactions, who doesn’t love stymying a would-be hacker?</p>
        <p>As the blockchain database isn’t stored in one single location, the records it keeps are kept public and verifiable. Its data, hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, is accessible to anyone on the internet. These millions of hosting computers are also the reason why a blockchain has no single point of failure.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the Financial: What Blockchains Can Really Do</h3>

        <p>While JP Morgan has used blockchain solutions in a fairly traditional sense, banking applications are only the tip of the iceberg for what blockchains can do.</p>

            <h3>Livestock</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Earlier, when we mentioned that Walmart had gotten in on the blockchain game, you probably didn’t think we meant in the context of livestock. In 2016, Walmart used blockchain technology to track how pigs from China were moving through the supply chain and onto American tables. While Walmart is no doubt hoping to save money by avoiding food spoilage, they’re also trying to prevent disease outbreaks.</p>
        <p>Even smaller farming outfits are beginning to follow in Walmart’s steps. A farmer’s collective in Arkansas recently began tracking poultry transactions with the use of a blockchain.</p>

            <h3>Shipping</h3>
        </header>
        <p>We don’t think about it a lot but every single day, a mind-blowing amount of inventory is shipped over our oceans. In fact, it’s so much cargo that companies are struggling to track it effectively. Enter blockchain.</p>
        <p>The world’s largest shipping company, Maersk, recently tested using blockchains to track its cargo. Working together with the shipper themselves, Dutch customs, and even the United States Department of Homeland Security, they all tracked the containers remotely.</p>
        <p>The idea is to rely on a cryptographic signature that makes it harder for anybody to misplace the goods or mess with the labels as the cargo is being moved. Additionally, streamlining the process is intended to reduce the amount of time the cargo is actually in transit. If we know where something is all the time, we can get it from point A to B without a mysterious delay over to Z.</p>

            <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Ah, contracts. Everyone’s favorite thing ever, right? While blockchain-solutions aren’t going to transform contract negotiations into a basket of puppies anytime soon, they can significantly streamline matters and make them at least partially more tolerable.</p>
        <p>As blockchains are still a relatively new addition to the contract game, the current applications are fairly simple but no less impressive for that. Smart contracts can be programmed to perform basic functions. For example, if a contract says that a derivative is to be paid out when a certain financial benchmark is met, blockchain technology can enable this payout to happen automatically. This significantly reduces both the amount of manpower required to manage a contract and the risk of frustrating and costly delays.</p>

         <h3>Sharing Economy</h3>
    </header>
    <p>With Uber, Lyft and AirBnB enjoying immense success, we can safely say that the sharing economy is in full swing. However, as it stands, a user who wants to use a ride-sharing service has to rely on an intermediary like Uber or Lyft.</p>
    <p>With blockchains, peer-to-peer payments could be a new reality for the sharing economy. Cutting out the middlemen, we could finally see transaction fees start to go the way of the dinosaurs and a real decentralized sharing economy could finally emerge.</p>

        <h3>File Storage</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Remember that time you stored a really important work file in the cloud and it vanished? Or how your co-worker did the same thing and got your company hacked? By using blockchain and decentralizing file storage on the internet and distributing data throughout the network, you protect your files from the dreaded fates of being hacked or lost.</p>

    <p>Depending on where you live, renewable energy is becoming increasingly common and blockchains have a role to play. With blockchain technology is is possible to buy and sell the renewable energy that is generated by neighborhood microgrids.</p>
