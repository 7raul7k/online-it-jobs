            <h3>Software Development</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Software exists in every aspect of our lives. Whether you are finding new music, ordering groceries, creating an email campaign for your business, or setting your home alarm system from your phone, you are using software. And its presence is only going to become more prevalent in our daily activities and our businesses. </p>
        <p>You’re well equipped to understand how software can offer a unique solution to problems (or just really cool ways to make life even easier). But have you ever thought about the companies behind the software? What exactly does a software development company really do? </p>

            <h3>What is a Software Development Company? </h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../images/2021-software-development-salary-trends.png">
        <p>A software development company (or team, depending on the agency), designs and develops custom software applications, frameworks, and tools that help solve problems or achieve a specific outcome. Like you have probably guessed, the people that make up this team are pretty smart. While every software development team or company is different, it will usually be made up of software architects or developers, at least one product owner (the person responsible for testing and working with the product to make sure it works correctly), and some sort of project manager. </p>

            <h3>What is a Software Development Company’s Process?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>While creating custom software tools and applications is as complex as you might guess, the process of creating those tools is actually straightforward. While each software development team will put their own unique spin on things, they’ll take customers through a process that is similar to the following. </p>

            <h3>Identify the Problem or Need</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../images/identify.jpg">
        <p>A good company will take the time to really understand your problem, your budget, your goals, and your desired outcome. Ideally, both parties will understand exactly what success looks like to be sure this partnership is a win for everyone. </p>
        <p>During this time, your software development team should also get a feel for what kind of software will best meet your needs. For example, will you be best served by an app, an intranet, or a website (like Hubspot or SalesForce)?</p>

            <h3>Create and Develop</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../images/software.png">
        <p>After working closely with you to get this project off the ground, the software development company you’re working with will begin developing your custom software. They’ll start with a visual wireframe that helps you “see” what your product will look like, and then they will begin building it out with code. In the same way that no one wants to live in a house that was built in a day, you don’t want to pay for custom software that was rushed during this process. Make sure you know what to expect in terms of communication so you can stay up to date on progress and so you know when you will have the chance to request any edits. </p>

            <h3>Test and Troubleshoot</h3>
        </header>
        <img src="../../images/future-software.png">
        <p>Once your software has been built, it needs to be tested and used. The team’s product owner will use the software just like your ideal customer would, and will note any issues that might arise: glitches, slow loading speeds, random shutdowns, etc. Before your tool ever goes live, your software development team will test everything to be sure it works and accomplishes your goals. </p>

            <h3>Distribute</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Once your product is finished, the software team will help you distribute it in the appropriate channels, such as the App Store or through email or social campaigns. </p>
